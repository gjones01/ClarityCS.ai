# ClearVision.AI
**Computer Vision cheat detection utilizing Deep Learning.**

ClearVision is an experimental, research-driven project using Deep Learning and computer vision to detect suspicious gameplay behavior for Counter Strike 2:
- Aimbotting
- Wallhacking
- Unnatural flicks/corsshair movement

Modern cheats utilize exploits such as DLL file manipulation to inject scripts into the game code. The theory behind ClearVision.ai is to create a Neural Network that watches game footage. Rather than looking at raw game data (which can be manipulated), analyze the pixels on the screen. There is very limited literature on using computer vision on raw video input. However, cheat developers are already ahead of the curve, utilizing computer vision for real time aimbots that 100% bypass traditional anti-cheat systems such as Ricochet Anti-Cheat. If it can be used to develope cheats, there is a way to leverage it for detecting them.

This repository will act as a public space for updates, research notes, model performance and dev logs. Currently, there is a ReadME (this) and an architecture file that goes over the basic structure of my current model without going into too much detail. Finally there is a picture folder where I will be updating a lot more images of progress being made lately. 

Again, this is a passion project I do in my spare time, so there is no specific timeline at the moment of releasing a Beta.

ðŸ”’ Source code is currently private while development is in progress.  
ðŸ“ˆ Stay tuned for results, benchmarks, and visualizations.
